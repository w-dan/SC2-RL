Creation of a **Reinforcement Learning** agent that plays **Starcraft II**. This project emerges from the interest on reinforcement learning and the complexity of a stratigic game like starcraft.

## Setup steps

- If you are using windows, you need to install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/), once it is installed, select `Desktop development with C++`. After installed, `gymnasium[box2d]` will work.

- If you are using WSL, follow this steps: [WSL Installation](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2/blob/develop/README.md#wsl)

1. [Starcraft II](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/) installed in your system
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.7
3. Install dependecy [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2)
4. Create a folder named `logs` on parent folder
5. Create a folder named `Maps` under your `Starcraft II` installation folder.
6. Add maps (.SC2MAP files) under previous folder, they are available for download in sites such as [sc2mapster](https://www.sc2mapster.com/maps).
    1. For this use case, [scorpion](https://www.sc2mapster.com/projects/desert-map-melee-1v1) map is used.
